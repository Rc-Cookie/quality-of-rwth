This is a browser extension to improve some of the web pages of the RWTH University, particularly those ones who students have to use on a daily basis.
This includes:

 - Automatically forwarding unnecessary "To log in, click here" pages
 - Skipping the incredibly slow, and asides, useless PDF annotator and just displays the PDF directly
 - Automatically continues when the browser fills in username and password on SSO
 - Automatically fills in subsequent login and authentification forms once the user has given permission to an app once
 - Adds a dropdown to the toolbar to quickly access all Moodle courses, to avoid having to wait ages for the dashboard to load just to immediately leave it again
 - Adds an option to download OpenCast videos, or for those very fancy, supplies the stream link so that a different streaming service can be used

All features can be turned off individually.

I'm not usually coding in JS or HTML, so don't expect any masterpiece, particularly not in terms of design. Form follows function.
